- GIT - it is not just random 3 letters
- Created by Linus Torvalds in 2005 (the same person who created Linux)

## General TFS and TFVC
- TFS (Team Foundation Server)
Microsoftâ€™s on-premises suite for:
Version control
Build automation
Bug tracking
Project management (work items, Agile boards, etc.)
- TFS supports two kinds of version control:
  - TFVC (centralized, older)
  - Git (distributed, modern)

TFS was later renamed to Azure DevOps Server.

- In short:
  - TFVC = just the centralized version control system.
  - TFS = the whole DevOps/ALM platform, which includes TFVC (or Git).
